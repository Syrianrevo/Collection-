The housing market in the U.S was healthy and thriving at the beginning of 2020. Home Prices were very stable and steadily increasing, but when the pandemic hit the united states shore everything was changed. The US mortgage industry has been experiencing stress after years of calm. Even comparing to the previous financial crisis in 2008 this time the struggle is real. Covid 19 hit the economy hard and unemployment rates have been increasing since. A lot of homeowners have lost their jobs, and are now not able to pay back their monthly payments. Even with the help of the federal government when they released the coronavirus aid relief, and the cares act. The government granted relief options for federally backed loan which what 70% of homebuyers have. As of June, almost about 5 million mortgages were in forbearance which represents 12% of the total outstanding mortgages.

The mortagage industry was in a stronger position than it was going into last financial crises. Before covid 19 most banks were having a much healthier credit book and substantially lower levels of delinquencies and foreclosures. Demand-supply were stable, and housing prices were at favorable levels. 
As the forbearance period nears its end and unemployment remains at elevated levels, delinquencies could rise to new levels. For instance, 30-day delinquencies are expected to peak at 14.2% in 2021 (figure 1), compared with a 12.1% peak in 2009 after the last financial crisis.
